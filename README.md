# GreenChallenge
Gamified ecological sustainability.

## Motivation
Fighting climate change requires colossal efforts across the globe. Impact by individual contributors is limited, which can be demotivating. 
GreenChallenge remedies this by combining the efforts of contributors across the world, creating a grass-roots movement to bring about the necessary change.

## Concept
At the core, players are encouraged to solve one "challenge" per day.

### Challenges
Challenges come in two sizes: big (L) and small (S).

Challenges can take on various forms:
1. petitions - signing a petition.
1. education - reading / watching something or taking a short quiz.
1. donations - e.g. to various initiatives, projects and organizations that tackel ecological sustainability.
1. and many more

Challenges can fall into one or more category:
1. political: putting pressure on decision makers.
1. economic: changing the economic realities can lead to the current state of warming.
1. mitigation: reducing the impact of global warming in one way or another.
1. motivational: motivating other players to solve challenges and join the movement.


### Gamification
GreenChallange will use a social gamification approach for a high long-term engagement among players.

Gamification elements to be used are:
1. points for a sense of **progress**
1. leaderboards for **social comparison**
1. group activities for **social** effects
1. (badges as elements of extrinsic rewards)
